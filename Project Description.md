# CS378-Project
CS378 Project
This may be a completely different project by the end of this, but this is what I want to do:
What I want to do is that I want to make a Code translator.
1. I needs to be able to recognize key words and follow that pattern I set in place for it.
2. The translator needs to be able to recognize the word and then execute the proper sequence.
3. The big keywords that I would need for the translator to:
say: = cout << << endl;
if: = if()
else if:  = else if()
else: = else()
for: = for()
while: = while()
value: = int
bigValue: = double
pointValue: float
sentence: = string
letter: = char
module: = "%"
equal: = "="
equivalent: = "=="
subtract: = "-"
add: = "+"
multiply: = "*" //*
divide: = "/"
notEquivalent: = "!="


Some ideas that I have to start working one this project is:
1. See how other translators work and build my work based off that. 
2. Create my own language that will be able to translate the languages as I need be.
3. Take an existing translator, and build off of that.
4. Take psudo code that I have done, and try to write it in this new language that I have made
