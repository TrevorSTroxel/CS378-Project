CS378 Project
Since I lost my partner, this my be a compleatly different project by the end of this, but this is what I want to do:
What I want to do is that I want to make a Google Docs add-on that makes it more like Visual Studio.
1. What I want it do is that I want it to have the HUD of what Visual Studio looks like.
2. It needs to be a simple version of what Visual Studio has, in order to make sure that things are simple enough to understand.
3. I want it to have some form of a debugger, and you to have the ability to be able to adjust break points.
4. I want it to work with all languages, but for right now, C++ is the only one im concerned about.
5. If you want to run the program, everyone that is online and working on it have to agree to it before you run it.
6. You can create more files (.h and .cpp files) while working on it.
7. Once you are done with it, you can export it into a readable file format for visual studio to read.

Some ideas that I have to start working one this project is:
1. an see how Visual Studio is made and see how it works and try and impliment what it has into a google docs add-on. Another idea is that 2.an see what componets that i need for a google docs, such as the UML and other things like that, and try to implement them slowly.

say: hello world -> cout << "hello world" << endl;
