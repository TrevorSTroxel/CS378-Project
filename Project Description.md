# CS378-Project
CS378 Project
Since I lost my partner, this may be a completely different project by the end of this, but this is what I want to do:
What I want to do is that I want to make a Code translator as a google docs add-on.
1. I needs to be able to recognize key words and follow that pattern I set in place for it.
2. Ex: if the sentence says say: hello world, the translator would translate this as cout << "hello world" << endl;.
3. Other key words will be added later.
4. Later on I would like it to translate into other languages, such as Python, C#, and other languages.

Some ideas that I have to start working one this project is:
1. See how other translators work and build my work based off that. 
2. Create my own language that will be able to translate the languages as I need be.
3. Take an existing translator, and build off of that.
