# CS378-Project
CS378 Project
Since I lost my partner, this may be a completely different project by the end of this, but this is what I want to do:
What I want to do is that I want to make a Code translator as a google docs add-on.
1. I needs to be able to recognize key words and follow that pattern I set in place for it.
2. The translator needs to be able to recognize the colon, grab the word that comes before the colon, and then run its translation
3. The big keywords that I would need for the translator to:
say: = cout << << endl;
if: = if()
else if:  = else if()
else: = else()
for: = for()
while: = while()
value: = int
bigValue: = double
pointValue: float
sentence: = string
letter: = char
module: = "%"
equal: = "="
equivalent: = "=="
subtract: = "-"
add: = "+"
multiply: = "*" //*
divide: = "/"
notEquivalent: = "!="


Some ideas that I have to start working one this project is:
1. See how other translators work and build my work based off that. 
2. Create my own language that will be able to translate the languages as I need be.
3. Take an existing translator, and build off of that.
4. Take psudo code that I have done, and try to write it in this new language that I have made
